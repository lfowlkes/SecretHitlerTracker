			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>In the nearly ten thousand years since our professor first assigned us to work with the La Tabla software, our team has grown accustomed to the feeling of total failure. La Tabla combines component recognition, tabletop projection and a game engine to allow for user interaction unique possibilities, and our modest initial goal was to simply load up one of the game worlds already in the software and get it to work. Because La Tabla is basically just an Xcode project, and because it requires a specific version of Xcode along with a specific version of a third-party library, only Lauren could actually run it on her computer. Even then we were unable to get the software to recognize the input devices correctly on a consistent basis. We reached out to the original developer but he said he could not attest to the present state of the project as he had ceased working on it for some time. When it came time to update the rest of the class on our progress, we had little to show.</p>
			<p>With only a few weeks left to create a project, we settled on a tool for Secret Hitler, which Lauren introduced everyone to. The tool calculates the probability of the various claims players make in the game being true, thus enhancing their ability to tell true claims from false ones. With this tool, take your hardcore fascist hunting skills to a whole new level!</p>

			<h2>Project Background</h2>
			<p>We didn't know of any pre-existing SH probability tool at the time of starting this project, although there seem to be student-built probability tools for other games on the web such as <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kmliu/mtg_calculator.html" target="_blank">this one</a> for Magic. We decided to work on it because SH was fun, we needed something to do, and (as Lauren might attest) the probabilities that our tool spits out are a matter of extreme consequence for those who play this game frequently. We could have made this on many platforms but we decided to go with Phaser since it's the one we're all most familiar with. While most of us learned the game by playing together on <a href="https://secrethitler.io/" target="_blank">secrethitler.io</a> (bottom image), we decided to design our tool around the physical game and even bought the physical copy ourselves for this purpose.</p>

			<h2>Project Testing</h2>
            <p>Lauren ran the first test with some of her friends when the tool was still in its beta stages. Since her friends weren't local, they did their playtest using the same online Secret Hitler site that our team used to learn the game. Her playtest had its pros and cons, like all things. On one hand, her friend group has been playing Secret Hitler games consistently for a few years, so they were exactly the demographic the tool was aimed at. On the other hand, though, the tool was still in development at the time of playtesting, so some of teh playtest feedback was marred by bugs or other features that had yet to be implemented.</p>
            <p>Michael was the first one to test the tool when it was close to completion. He tested it with his housemates, who were somewhat familiar with Secret Hitler. Luckily the tool had come a long way since then, and was actually able to be used as intended. They were somewhat the middle-of-the-road testing wise, in that the tool was sometimes useful for their plays in order to enhance an argument when it suited them, but wasn't something they really needed all the time.</p>
            <p> Our last playtest with some Secret Hitler noobies was, unfortunately, not our most useful playtest. Since our tool was aimed at those who were experienced at the game and could use the tool to better enahnce the convulted arguments that come with long-time players, the new players didn't have much use for it. They spent most of their time just trying to learn the game, and arguments about probability were on a level they weren't ready for yet. However, they did give us positive feedback about general usability and interface design.</p>

			<h2>Next Steps & Future Development Opportunities</h2>
            <p>If we had more time (and didn't waste 2/3 the quarter fighting with La Tabla) the first thing we would do would be to make the tool look prettier. Right now it just spits out a bunch of text and if we could bring it up to par with online sites like secrethitler.io in terms of aesthetics and clarity that would be awesome. Beyond that, we would have liked to make the tool have more generi functionality so that the probability calculator could be used to help people figure out their odds and best routes forward in other games, like Blackjack or Yahtzee.</p>
            <p>As it is, we might take some time on our own to fine-tune the project after the class ends. Lauren has been wanting a tool like this for her own Secret Hitler games, and even though we have no plans to do anything marketable with it or put it up for sale, it would be a handy thing to be able to use in casual Secret Hitler games with friends.</p>
