		    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>In the nearly ten thousand years since our professor first assigned us to work with the La Tabla software, our team has grown accustomed to the feeling of total failure. La Tabla combines component recognition, tabletop projection and a game engine to allow for user interaction unique possibilities, and our modest initial goal was to simply load up one of the game worlds already in the software and get it to work. Because La Tabla is basically just an Xcode project, and because it requires a specific version of Xcode along with a specific version of a third-party library, only Lauren could actually run it on her computer. Even then we were unable to get the software to recognize the input devices correctly on a consistent basis. We reached out to the original developer but he said he could not attest to the present state of the project as he had ceased working on it for some time. When it came time to update the rest of the class on our progress, we had little to show.</p>
		    <p>With only a few weeks left to create a project, we settled on a tool for Secret Hitler, which Lauren introduced everyone to. The tool calculates the probability of the various claims players make in the game being true, thus enhancing their ability to tell true claims from false ones. With this tool, take your hardcore fascist hunting skills to a whole new level!</p>

		    <h2>Project Background</h2>
		    <p>We didn't know of any pre-existing SH probability tool at the time of starting this project. We decided to work on it because SH was fun, we needed something to do, and (as Lauren might attest) the probabilities that our tool spits out are a matter of extreme consequence for those who play this game frequently. We could have made this on many platforms but we decided to go with Phaser since it's the one we're all most familiar with. While most of us learned the game by playing together on <a href="https://secrethitler.io/" target="_blank">secrethitler.io</a> (bottom image), we decided to design our tool around the physical game and even bought the physical copy ourselves for this purpose.</p>
